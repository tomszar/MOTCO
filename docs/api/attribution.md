# Orientation Driver Attribution

Orientation attribution explains a two-group, multi-stage difference after an
upstream trajectory analysis has identified the shared PLS space of interest.
Pass the pooled, aligned feature matrix, matching group/stage metadata, and
the one fitted PLS estimator to `analyze_orientation_attribution`.

The analysis orders groups and stages deterministically unless explicit levels
are supplied. For every adjacent stage pair it reports each group's raw
transition and path length, the unit directional contrast, the same contrast
after PLS score projection and inverse transformation, and the signed residual
`observed - pls_captured`. Observed feature values remain in the result; the
reconstruction is a parallel, lossy view rather than a replacement.

## Two decompositions

Attribution reports two decompositions, and they explain different quantities.

The **principal-orientation** block decomposes the tested `angle` estimand:
principal-axis divergence, the contrast between the groups' signed leading
principal axes. It applies the same functional the statistic is built from
(`motco.stats.trajectory.principal_orientation`) to each group's stage-mean
configuration, observed and PLS-reconstructed, so the explanation and the test
cannot drift apart.

The **per-adjacent-transition** blocks describe where along the trajectory the
groups' step directions diverge. They are a per-step description, not the tested
estimand; the two decompositions coincide only for a two-stage design, where the
configuration is rank one and PC1 is the transition direction.

Both appear in the tabular outputs under the `transition_id` column — the
transitions as `from->to`, the principal block under `principal_component_id`
(default `principal`), which is validated against the stage-derived identifiers
so the two can never collide.

## Degeneracy and availability

A principal axis exists for any configuration with variance, but it is only
resolvable when one axis dominates. The result reports each contributing
configuration's relative eigengap and flags the principal contrast `degenerate`
when any falls below `eigengap_threshold` (default `0.05`). The flagged contrast
is still returned: degeneracy is a property of the data, so callers stratify on
the flag rather than lose rows.

That is distinct from unavailability. A trajectory whose net displacement from
first stage to last is at or below `zero_tolerance` is closed, and no direction
is defined at all — that group's principal orientation is marked unavailable,
exactly as a zero-length transition is.

## Units and stability

Effects are reported in the input coordinate units, normally pooled
standardized units. Positive per-feature scales can be supplied to add
original-unit columns. These scales only convert reported effects; they never
change PLS geometry.

Bootstrap resampling is independent within every group-by-stage cell and uses
the same fitted model and preprocessing contract in every replicate. The
result records the seed, requested count, valid count, sign stability, and
top-k selection frequency, for the principal-orientation block as well as the
transitions. Each replicate's principal axis is signed by that replicate's own
net displacement, so resampling noise cannot flip the axis; a replicate whose
trajectory closes contributes no contrast and counts as invalid. Bootstrap is available for arithmetic row-derived
means; precomputed covariate-adjusted mean tables are accepted with stability
marked unavailable.

## Labels and interpretation

Feature-to-module or feature-to-pathway labels are optional and must be a
complete one-to-one mapping supplied by the caller. Aggregate tables preserve
the labels and mark their source as `caller-supplied`. Aggregation is not a
pathway annotation service and does not establish biological causality.

The result contains no p-values or significance decisions. Attribution should
be run after the calling workflow has made any global orientation inference
decision. It describes associations implied by one frozen shared PLS model;
the inverse reconstruction is not unique, and bootstrap stability is
conditional on that fitted representation.
