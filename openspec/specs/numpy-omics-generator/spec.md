# numpy-omics-generator Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change numpy-feature-surgery-generator. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: numpy generator reproduces InterSIM's mean-shift model
MOTCO SHALL provide a numpy-native multi-omic generator that produces methylation, gene expression, and proteomics matrices using InterSIM's generative model: each stage mean is `μ = base + δ · v` for a per-stage differential indicator `v ∈ {0,1}ᵖ`, with samples drawn from a multivariate normal with the reference covariance, and methylation passed through the inverse-logit (`rev.logit`) transform after the additive shift.

#### Scenario: Generates the three aligned omic matrices
- **WHEN** the generator is invoked with valid parameters
- **THEN** it returns methylation, expression, and proteomics matrices with the same number of rows, aligned to a shared sample order

#### Scenario: Methylation shift is applied in logit space
- **WHEN** a differential shift is applied to methylation features
- **THEN** the shift is added to the pre-logit (M-value) mean and the inverse-logit transform is applied last, so methylation values remain in `(0, 1)`

#### Scenario: Cross-omic coupling is preserved
- **WHEN** differential expression and proteomics features are derived by default from the differential methylation features
- **THEN** the generator maps differential CpGs to genes and genes to proteins using the cached cross-omic maps

### Requirement: Generation uses cached InterSIM reference data with provenance
The generator SHALL source its reference means, covariances, and cross-omic maps from a cached artifact committed to the repository, recorded with provenance, and reproducible by a one-time export.

#### Scenario: Reference cache is loaded without R
- **WHEN** the generator runs
- **THEN** it loads the reference means, covariances, and maps from the cached artifact without invoking R

#### Scenario: Provenance is recorded
- **WHEN** the reference cache is produced
- **THEN** it records the InterSIM version, export date, and the export procedure used to create it

### Requirement: Generation is reproducible by seed and requires no R at runtime
The generator SHALL be deterministic given its seed and parameters, and SHALL NOT require an R runtime.

#### Scenario: Same seed produces identical matrices
- **WHEN** the generator is invoked twice with the same seed and parameters
- **THEN** the returned matrices are identical

#### Scenario: Runs without Rscript on PATH
- **WHEN** the generator is invoked in an environment with no `Rscript`
- **THEN** generation succeeds using only the cached reference data

### Requirement: Generator realism is validated against InterSIM
The generator's output distributions SHALL be validated to match InterSIM's across a swept, replicate-based protocol — not a single degenerate point — as a guard against reimplementation drift and as paper-supportable evidence of fidelity. The validation SHALL run InterSIM and the numpy generator each multiple times per parameter cell over a grid of `delta` and `p.DMP`, and SHALL compare, per cell: per-omic marginal moments/quantiles, cluster separation (η²), differential-feature rates (the DMP→DEG→DEP coupling), covariance structure, and cross-omic coupling. Agreement SHALL be judged against InterSIM's own sampling distribution (the numpy statistic falling within InterSIM's documented central interval), so the criterion accounts for InterSIM's RNG variability. The InterSIM side SHALL be captured as committed fixtures so the validation runs without R, and SHALL be reproducible from a committed R script with recorded provenance.

#### Scenario: Fidelity holds across the parameter sweep
- **WHEN** the validation is run over the `delta` × `p.DMP` grid
- **THEN** for each cell and each compared statistic, the numpy generator's value falls within InterSIM's documented central interval for that statistic

#### Scenario: Effect injection and cross-omic coupling are validated at non-zero effect
- **WHEN** the validation is run at `delta > 0`
- **THEN** cluster separation (η²) and differential-feature rates (DMP→DEG→DEP) for the numpy generator agree with InterSIM's distribution, exercising the effect injection and the cross-omic coupling that a `delta = 0` check cannot

#### Scenario: Validation runs without R from committed fixtures
- **WHEN** the validation runs in CI with no `Rscript` available
- **THEN** it compares the numpy generator against the committed InterSIM summary fixtures and passes without invoking R

#### Scenario: Fixtures are reproducible with recorded provenance
- **WHEN** the InterSIM fixtures are regenerated
- **THEN** the committed R script reproduces them, and the fixtures record the InterSIM version, generation date, seeds, and the parameter grid

#### Scenario: A reproducible supplementary artifact is produced
- **WHEN** the supplementary artifact generator is run against the committed fixtures
- **THEN** it produces a paper-ready table and figure summarizing numpy-vs-InterSIM fidelity across the grid

#### Scenario: A qualitative visual supplement is produced
- **WHEN** the visual-supplement generator is run against regenerated InterSIM raw data (produced with InterSIM via the dev flake) with the numpy side generated live
- **THEN** it renders side-by-side InterSIM-vs-numpy figures — per-omic marginal densities, per-modality clustermap heatmaps (with sample/feature dendrograms and a cluster colour bar), per-modality PCA, per-feature mean/variance agreement scatter, and a cross-omic coupling correlation block
- **AND** the InterSIM raw matrices are not committed to the repository; the rendering code is exercised R-free in CI via a synthetic stand-in fixture

### Requirement: Generator exposes per-stage differential indicators
The generator SHALL expose, as output, the differential-feature indicator used for each stage (and group) so downstream consumers can use the ground truth.

#### Scenario: Differential indicators are returned per stage
- **WHEN** generation succeeds
- **THEN** the per-stage differential-feature indicators for each omic layer are available in the returned truth structure
