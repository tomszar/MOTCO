# MOTCO trajectory power study

This package (`motco.simulations.study`) is the engine behind the
reproducible Type I error / power study for the MOTCO trajectory test
(`delta`, `angle`, `shape`). It enumerates a grid of semi-synthetic
datasets from the numpy generator (cached InterSIM reference data, no R
at runtime), runs the full MOTCO pipeline on each replicate, and
produces summary tables, figures, and an acceptance-target report.

This README is the operational handbook: enough for anyone
to run and replicate the study end-to-end, locally or on
a SLURM cluster.

---

## 1. What the study computes

For each cell in the grid × replicate, the runner:

1. Generates aligned methylation, expression, and proteomics matrices
   via the numpy generator and cached InterSIM reference data (no R).
2. Injects a group trajectory difference as feature-set surgery on the
   per-stage differential indicators, in one of the modes below.
3. Runs the MOTCO trajectory pipeline (integration → design →
   `estimate_difference` → RRPP).
4. Records per-statistic p-values (`delta`, `angle`, `shape`) plus a
   pre-registered combined rule.

**Trajectory modes**

| Mode          | Role                                                                  |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `none`        | Type I baseline (identical groups). Always added by the enumerator.   |
| `translation` | Negative control — constant location offset (no geometry change).     |
| `magnitude`   | Power probe for `delta` (uniformly scales every step).                |
| `orientation` | Power probe for `angle` (global feature permutation = rotation).      |
| `shape`       | Power probe for `shape` (perturbs interior-stage overlaps).           |

Reports cover three views:

- **Type I table** — rejection rates on `none` cells (target ≈ α).
- **Specificity matrix** — off-diagonal rejection rates: each mode ×
  each statistic. Diagonal entries are power; off-diagonals should
  stay near α.
- **Power curves** — per-statistic rejection rate vs `effect_size` per
  mode.

Optional **acceptance targets** (Type I control, power monotonicity,
specificity) are evaluated against Monte Carlo uncertainty and saved
to a non-gating report.

Driver scripts live at the repo root under `scripts/`:

- `scripts/run_study_shard.py` — one shard per invocation (one cluster array task).
- `scripts/motco_study.py` — `merge` + `report` subcommands for post-processing.
- `scripts/motco_study_array.sbatch` — SLURM array template.

Example configs live under `examples/trajectory_power_study/`:

- `smoke.json` — tiny end-to-end smoke (~minutes locally, not paper-grade).

## 3. Pipeline

```
config (YAML or JSON)
    │
    ▼  scripts/run_study_shard.py        ← one cluster array task per shard
    │     writes shard_<i>.jsonl (signature-guarded, resumable)
    ▼  scripts/motco_study.py merge      ← shard_*.jsonl → merged.jsonl
    │
    ▼  scripts/motco_study.py report     ← CSVs + PNGs + acceptance report
```

Two orthogonal parallelism layers:

1. **Across shards** — one SLURM array task per shard
   (`$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID`).
2. **Within a shard** — `--n-jobs $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK` forwards to
   RRPP's permutation loop via the evaluation params.

---

## 4. Configuration

Configs are YAML or JSON; both go through `load_study_config()`. The
schema lives in `config.py` (`StudyConfig`). Required top-level keys:

| Field              | Purpose                                                                |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `generator`        | Baseline numpy-generator params (sizing, `n_stages`, `p_dmp`, per-omic `delta_*`, perturbation). `seed` is required. |
| `evaluation`       | Integration method, RRPP permutations, `n_jobs`, eval seed.            |
| `trajectory_modes` | Modes enumerated in the power grid. `none` is always added.            |
| `effect_sizes`     | Non-negative effect-size sweep (per mode).                             |
| `axes`             | Optional OFAT axes. Keys must be namespaced `generator.*` or `evaluation.*`, or the one nested form `evaluation.integration_params.<key>` (see below). |
| `design_grid`      | Optional **crossed** axes (`{"axes": {...}}`); every combination is a design point with its own anchored power grid. Each axis must list its baseline value. |
| `n_replicates`     | Replicates per cell.                                                   |
| `base_seed`        | Deterministic seed root for replicates.                                |
| `alpha`            | Significance level for rejection rates.                                |
| `acceptance`       | Pre-specified targets: `type_i`, `power`, `specificity`, optional `gate`, optional `design_point` (advisory design-point rule over a `design_grid`), optional `rank_decision` (advisory retained-rank rule over the rank axis). |
| `report_contract`  | Optional declared reporting/execution rules: `driver_component` (`observed` \| `pls_captured` \| `residual`; which attribution component `driver_report.csv` and the attribution figure present), `cross_replicate_driver_agreement` (only `descriptive` is legal — cross-replicate Jaccard/sign agreement is never a stability claim), `n_jobs_override` (`forbid` \| `warn`, default `warn`; `forbid` makes the shard runner refuse a differing `--n-jobs`). When declared, `report` also writes `report_contract.json` and `driver_report.csv`; when absent, every output is byte-identical to a pre-contract run. The Phase 5 profile declares `observed` / `descriptive` / `forbid`. |
| `metadata`         | Free-form provenance (name, intent, notes).                            |

Validation enforces:

- `trajectory_modes` ⊆ `{none, translation, magnitude, orientation, shape}`.
- `effect_sizes` are non-negative.
- `axes` keys use a known namespace prefix (`generator.*` or `evaluation.*`).
- `design_grid.axes` keys use the same namespaces, are not also OFAT axes, and
  each lists the baseline value; `acceptance.design_point.prefer` names only
  design-grid axes.
- `acceptance.rank_decision.axis` is a declared design-grid axis whose values
  include `null`; its target and protected modes are in `trajectory_modes`; both
  SE multipliers are non-negative.
- `0 < alpha < 1`.
- **The root mapping contains only the keys in the table above.** An unknown
  top-level key (a misspelled `report_contract`, say) fails to load with an
  error naming it instead of being silently ignored; every sub-block already
  rejected unknown fields.
- `report_contract`, when present, names a known `driver_component`, uses
  `cross_replicate_driver_agreement: descriptive`, and a known `n_jobs_override`.

### Nested evaluation axes

Both `axes` and `design_grid.axes` accept, besides top-level fields, exactly one
nested form: `evaluation.integration_params.<key>`. The value is set inside a
copy of the evaluation integration-parameter mapping (every other key
unchanged), so it enters the cell's evaluation parameters and therefore the
parameter signature. JSON `null` is a legal value meaning **key absent**: applying
it removes the key rather than storing `None`, so the baseline column's cells are
byte-identical (ids and signatures) to a config without the axis. The baseline
value of such an axis is the mapping's current value, or `null` when the key is
not set. Any other nesting (`generator.a.b`, `evaluation.attribution.x`) is
rejected by name.

The one use today is the retained PLS rank,
`evaluation.integration_params.forced_components`: `null` is the cross-validated
column, every other value fits the pooled PLS model at that fixed rank
(`component_selection = "forced"`, `selected_lv = <rank>` in the record's
integration metadata). Because the axis lives in the evaluation namespace,
design columns that differ only in it share the primary matched-seed family
**and** identical generator parameters — at every replicate index they evaluate
the same generated dataset under different measurement settings. The
duplicate-dataset guard accepts them on purpose (it keys on evaluation identity
too), and the report states the pairing wherever such columns are compared.

See `examples/trajectory_power_study/smoke.json` for a complete,
minimal example.

### Scaling smoke → paper-grade

The smoke config is meant to finish in minutes; for a real study you
typically want:

| Field                       | Smoke | Paper-grade (typical) |
|-----------------------------|-------|-----------------------|
| `generator.n_samples`       | 60    | 200–600               |
| `evaluation.permutations`   | 49    | 999 or 4999           |
| `n_replicates`              | 8     | 500–1000              |
| `effect_sizes`              | 4 pts | 5–8 pts incl. `0.0`   |

Keep `0.0` as the first effect size — it anchors the within-mode null
and is what the specificity/Type I checks read.

**Phase 5 cost.** The committed paper-grade profile
`examples/trajectory_power_study/phase5_power_study.json` (n = 1200, four
stages, `p_dmp = 0.1`, pooled PLS with double-CV rank, 999 permutations,
attribution on the orientation cells) is 19 cells × 500 replicates = 9,500
units. A one-replicate rehearsal on 2026-09-09 (19 units as 19 concurrent
single-threaded processes on a 24-core workstation, BLAS pinned) measured a
median **43 s per unit** (min 30, max 51; CV fit + 999 RRPP permutations +
attribution) — the attribution units cost the same as the others (median 42.9 s
vs 43.0 s), so the bootstrap is immaterial at n = 1200. Budget roughly 120
workstation core-hours, or about 150 EPYC 7662 core-hours if the ladder's
per-core ratio (57 s per CV unit at 199 permutations) carries over; 100
single-CPU shards finish in about 1.5–2 h wall.

## 5. Local smoke run

From the repo root, with the project virtualenv active:

```bash
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync --extra test
```

Run all shards locally:

```bash
for i in 0 1 2 3; do
  python scripts/run_study_shard.py \
    --config examples/trajectory_power_study/smoke.json \
    --out-dir /tmp/motco-smoke \
    --shard-index $i --n-shards 4 \
    --error-policy record
done

python scripts/motco_study.py merge  --out-dir /tmp/motco-smoke
python scripts/motco_study.py report \
    --config examples/trajectory_power_study/smoke.json \
    --out-dir /tmp/motco-smoke
```

Outputs (under `/tmp/motco-smoke/report/`):

- `specificity_matrix.csv` / `.png`
- `power_curves.csv` / `.png`
- `type_i_table.csv` / `type_i.png`
- `acceptance_report.csv` / `.json`

Run the smoke first on any new environment — it doubles as a sanity
check that the package (and its cached reference data) is wired up
correctly. No R is required at runtime.

---

## 6. SLURM cluster run

### 6.1 Prerequisites on the cluster

- Python (matching `pyproject.toml`) and `uv` (or `pip`) available on
  the compute nodes.
- **No R needed.** Generation runs on the numpy generator and the
  cached reference data (`src/motco/simulations/data/intersim_reference.npz`),
  which ships in the repo. R is only ever needed to *regenerate* that
  cache (see `export_reference.R`), not to run the study.
- The repo cloned and the virtualenv built once on a login node:
  `uv venv && uv sync --extra test`. The sbatch template activates
  `.venv/bin/activate` from the project root.

If your cluster uses `module load`/conda, add the appropriate `module
load python` (and any `conda activate`) lines before the `source
.venv/bin/activate` step in the sbatch script. No R module is required.

### 6.2 Choose `N_SHARDS`

Total replicates = `n_replicates × n_cells`, where `n_cells` is the
sum of (modes × effect_sizes) for the power grid plus one cell per
OFAT axis value. Aim for **~2–6 h per shard**:

```
N_SHARDS ≈ ceil(total_replicate_seconds / target_shard_seconds)
```

A short probe submission (`--array=0-0 --time=2:00:00`) gives a
realistic per-shard wallclock and memory profile. Use that to pick
both `N_SHARDS` and `--cpus-per-task`.

### 6.3 Edit the sbatch template

Open `scripts/motco_study_array.sbatch` and adjust:

- `#SBATCH --time`, `--cpus-per-task`, `--mem` — set from your probe.
- Partition / QOS / account flags (`-p`, `--qos`, `-A`) — cluster-specific.
- The `#SBATCH --array=0-N_SHARDS_MINUS_ONE` line is a placeholder;
  override with `--array=` on the command line at submit time.
- If your cluster needs `module load` / conda, add those calls before
  the `.venv/bin/activate` line.

The runner forwards `--n-jobs $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK` so RRPP saturates
the CPUs allocated to each task.

### 6.4 Submit

```bash
mkdir -p logs results

sbatch \
  --array=0-63 \
  --export=ALL,STUDY_CONFIG=$(pwd)/examples/trajectory_power_study/phase5_power_study.json,STUDY_OUT=$(pwd)/results,N_SHARDS=64 \
  scripts/motco_study_array.sbatch
```

Leave `STUDY_N_JOBS` unset. A config whose `report_contract` sets
`n_jobs_override: forbid` (the Phase 5 profile does) makes every array task
exit 2 before enumerating anything if `STUDY_N_JOBS` differs from its
`evaluation.n_jobs`; other configs warn and run at the overridden signature.

Required environment variables (via `--export`):

| Variable       | Meaning                                                         |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `STUDY_CONFIG` | Absolute path to the study config (YAML or JSON).               |
| `STUDY_OUT`    | Output directory for `shard_<i>.jsonl` files.                   |
| `N_SHARDS`     | Total shards. Must match the `--array` width.                   |

### 6.5 Merge + report after completion

```bash
python scripts/motco_study.py merge  --out-dir results
python scripts/motco_study.py report \
    --config examples/trajectory_power_study/phase5_power_study.json \
    --out-dir results
```

---

## 7. Failure handling and resumption

- **`--error-policy record`** (default in the sbatch template) lets a
  shard continue past a failed replicate; the failure is captured as
  a row with `status="failed"` in the shard JSONL. Use `raise` only
  when you want a single failure to abort the shard.
- **Signature-guarded resumability** — each `shard_<i>.jsonl` records
  the parameter signature it was produced with. Re-running the same
  shard skips replicates already completed for that signature and
  fills only what's missing or failed.
- **Resubmit only failed array tasks**:

  ```bash
  sbatch --array=7,12,40 \
         --export=ALL,STUDY_CONFIG=...,STUDY_OUT=...,N_SHARDS=64 \
         scripts/motco_study_array.sbatch
  ```

- **Forced overwrite** — pass `--overwrite` to `run_study_shard.py` to
  discard an existing shard JSONL before running. Use with care; this
  loses any completed replicates in that shard.
- **Worker-count lock** — `--n-jobs` enters the cell parameter signature
  and changes the realized permutation draws. When the config declares
  `report_contract.n_jobs_override: forbid`, `run_study_shard.py` refuses a
  `--n-jobs` that differs from `evaluation.n_jobs`: it prints both values
  and the signature consequence to stderr and exits **2** before enumerating
  or writing anything (an equal value is accepted). Under `warn`, or with no
  contract, it warns and proceeds at the overridden signature, as before.

---

## 8. Outputs

After `merge` + `report`, the output directory looks like:

```

    ├── acceptance_report.csv      acceptance target evaluation
    └── acceptance_report.json
```

With `acceptance.gate.enabled` the `phase4_*` tables and figures are written
as well (see "Phase 4 outputs" in the examples README); under a report
contract the attribution figure plots within-replicate bootstrap stability
only, for the declared component, while `phase4_attribution.csv` keeps every
component and the cross-replicate columns.

### Per-replicate record fields

Every JSONL record is one `SimulationReplicateResult`. Beyond the cell identity,
seeds, `p_values`, and `pair_statistics`, two fields carry the per-replicate
diagnostics:

- `realized_geometry` / `integration_metadata` / `attribution_diagnostics` — the
  Phase 4 diagnostics.
- `null_summary` — a compact per-statistic description of *that replicate's own*
  RRPP permutation null: `count` (retained draws, non-finite excluded), `mean`,
  `sd`, and `q50`/`q90`/`q95`/`q99`. It is written on every run with
  `permutations > 0`, independently of `include_null_distributions` (which
  controls only whether the full draw vectors are *returned*, never persisted).

  `null_summary` makes the pair *(observed statistic, its own critical value)*
  computable from a single record, which is what any pivotality or calibration
  question needs. It is **not** part of `parameter_signature` — it summarizes
  draws that already happened and changes no generation, integration, or
  permutation behavior — so records written before it existed still load (with an
  empty summary) and remain resumable. A record from a `permutations = 0` run is
  told apart from a pre-field record by `runtime_metadata["permutations"]`.

- `config_spectrum` — the eigenspectrum of the centered **stage-mean
  configuration in the evaluated latent space**, written on every run. It carries
  `pooled` (stages averaged across groups) and `groups` (one entry per group
  level), each with `n_points`, `n_dimensions`, `total_variance`, the normalized
  `spectrum`, and the **relative eigengap** `(l1 − l2) / Σl`. With
  `permutations > 0` it also carries `permutation_pooled_eigengap` — `count`,
  `mean`, `sd`, `q05`/`q50`/`q95` of the pooled eigengap over the permutation
  draws — so a replicate can be located against its own permutation
  distribution. Full per-permutation spectra are never retained.

  The eigengap is the covariate the [geometry
  audit](../../../../docs/reports/geometry-audit-2026-09-01.md) found predicts how
  wide a replicate's own `angle` permutation null will be, and therefore whether
  its orientation is resolvable at all. It is **recorded and reported only** — it
  enters no statistic, no p-value, and no decision rule. A configuration with
  zero total variance records `relative_eigengap: null` and an empty `spectrum`
  rather than a non-finite float; a two-stage configuration's eigengap is
  identically `1.0` and uninformative by construction.

  Unlike `null_summary`, the spectrum **is** signature-bearing:
  `parameter_signature` includes `config_spectrum_version`. A shard written
  before this field existed therefore **refuses resume** with the usual
  signature-mismatch error, rather than producing a merged set in which only some
  records carry the covariate — a missing covariate and a degenerate one are
  indistinguishable at analysis time. Already-merged pre-change record sets still
  *load* (the block is empty) and their committed reports are unaffected; only
  resuming *into* an old shard is refused.

### Eigengap reporting

`motco_study.py report` writes up to three spectrum tables beside the existing
ones, from recorded values only — no dataset is regenerated and no spectrum
recomputed:

- `config_spectrum.csv` — one row per (cell, configuration ∈ {`pooled`, group
  levels}) with `n_replicates` / `n_recorded` / `n_available` and the eigengap
  mean, sd, quartiles, min and max. `n_recorded` counts records carrying the
  block at all and `n_available` those whose eigengap is defined, so pre-field
  records and degenerate configurations stay separately visible.
- `eigengap_stratified_power.csv` — for orientation-mode power cells, rejection
  rates within **within-cell terciles** of the recorded pooled eigengap, with
  per-stratum counts and Monte Carlo SEs. A cell whose records carry no spectrum
  is emitted with `status = unavailable` rather than dropped.
- `continuity_resolved_orientation.csv` — **only when the merged set spans more
  than one `generator.baseline_continuity` value.** One row per (continuity,
  mode, effect, statistic) with the rejection rate, the recorded pooled-eigengap
  distribution (mean and terciles), and the dispersion of
  `null_summary["angle"]["q95"]`. The eigengap is the point of the table: power
  that rises along ρ should be traceable to a configuration that acquired a
  dominant axis, which is the observable that carries a continuity-conditioned
  orientation claim to real data — not the knob itself. A study that holds the
  axis fixed writes no such file, and records predating the axis are excluded
  rather than folded into the ρ = 0 bin. When the grid is a `design_grid`, rows
  are additionally keyed on every other design coordinate (emitted as columns),
  so a ρ × `n_samples` grid never pools three operating points into one row.

### Design-point reporting

A config with a `design_grid` enumerates one anchored power grid per design
point (phase `power_design`, metadata `design_point = {axis: value}`,
`varied_axis = "design_grid"`); the baseline point is the primary grid, stamped
with its coordinates. Design cells join the primary matched-seed family and are
invisible to every baseline reader (power curves, specificity matrix, Type I
table, Phase 4 gate, acceptance targets). The report then writes:

- `design_point_operating.csv` — one row per (design coordinates, mode, effect,
  statistic), anchors included as `none` at `0.0`: rejection rate ± MC SE, the
  recorded pooled-eigengap distribution, the `angle` null-width (`q95`)
  dispersion, and the selected-dimensionality distribution.
- `design_point_power.png` — the target statistic's power at the top effect per
  point against the first design axis, one line per value of the second,
  annotated with the median eigengap.
- `design_point_decision.json` / `.csv` — when `acceptance.design_point`
  declares the rule (`trajectory_mode`, `statistic`, `min_power_at_top`,
  `confirmation_se_threshold`, `prefer`): per column `meets` (`rate − k·SE ≥
  floor`), `marginal` (point estimate only), `fails`, or `unavailable`, with
  the anchor's Type I rates beside it, and a verdict — the first `meets` column
  in preference order, or `revise_claim`. Advisory only.

The committed Phase 5 design-point pilot,
`examples/trajectory_power_study/phase5_design_point_pilot.json`, crosses
ρ ∈ {0.0, 0.5, 0.8} with `n_samples` ∈ {300, 600, 1200} at `p_dmp = 0.1`.

Every row of `design_point_operating.csv` also carries `component_selection`
(`cv` / `forced`, or `mixed` — which cannot arise from a well-formed study and
flags a configuration error), read from the records' integration metadata.

### Retained-rank ladder reporting

When the design grid declares `evaluation.integration_params.forced_components`
(see *Nested evaluation axes*), the report additionally writes:

- `rank_ladder.png` — per trajectory mode (the zero-effect anchor first), each
  statistic's rejection rate at the mode's top effect against the retained rank
  with MC error bars; the cross-validated column is drawn at its recorded median
  selected rank with a star marker and a `CV` label so it is never read as a
  forced rung. Built from `design_point_operating.csv` alone; not written for
  grids without the rank axis.
- `rank_decision.json` / `.csv` — when `acceptance.rank_decision` declares the
  rule (`axis`, `target` pair, `protected` pairs, `type_i_bound`,
  `gain_se_multiplier`, `loss_se_multiplier`). With the `null` (CV) column as
  reference, a forced rank *qualifies* when (a) its target power at the top
  effect exceeds the reference by more than the gain multiplier × pooled MC SE,
  (b) its zero-effect anchor is within `alpha + se_tolerance·sqrt(alpha(1−alpha)/n)`
  on every statistic, and (c) no protected power at the top effect falls below
  the reference by more than the loss multiplier × pooled SE. Verdict `keep_cv`
  when no rank qualifies, else `adopt_fixed_rank` naming the **smallest**
  qualifying rank (parsimony predeclared); per column, every criterion's status
  with the rates, SEs, and thresholds it used, and the failing pairs/statistics
  by name. Advisory only: it never feeds the Phase 4 gate or the acceptance
  targets. The JSON states that columns are paired on identical datasets.

The production guard that refuses forced-rank records
(`assert_production_component_selection`) admits a forced record only when its
design point declares the rank axis with the same rank the integration recorded;
any other forced record is still rejected. Forced columns stay invisible to the
power curves, specificity matrix, Type I table, gate, and acceptance targets.

The committed Phase 5 latent-rank ladder,
`examples/trajectory_power_study/phase5_latent_rank_ladder.json`, holds the
chosen design point fixed (ρ = 0, n = 1200, `p_dmp = 0.1`) and varies only the
rank over {`null`, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12} for all four modes.

### Angle-pivotality diagnostic

`scripts/angle_null_pivotality.py` reads a merged record set and reports whether
each replicate's null moved with its own observed statistic:

```bash
# 5 cells x 100 replicates = 500 work units; ~26 minutes on 16 cores.
for i in $(seq 0 15); do
  python scripts/run_study_shard.py \
      --config examples/trajectory_power_study/angle_pivotality_diagnostic.json \
      --out-dir results/angle-pivotality-2026-09-01 \
      --shard-index "$i" --n-shards 16 --error-policy record &
done
wait
python scripts/motco_study.py merge --out-dir results/angle-pivotality-2026-09-01
python scripts/angle_null_pivotality.py \
    --merged  results/angle-pivotality-2026-09-01/merged.jsonl \
    --out-dir results/angle-pivotality-2026-09-01/report
```

Do **not** pass `--n-jobs`: it is part of the cell parameter signature, so
overriding it changes the permutation draws and breaks resume.

It writes `pivotality_association.csv` (correlation and slope of the null's
mean/sd/q95 against the observed statistic, with a Fisher-z interval),
`pivotality_rejection_split.csv` (observed statistic and critical value split by
rejection outcome), `pivotality_standardized.csv` (as-specified vs
cross-replicate standardized rejection rate, controls included), and
`pivotality_spectrum.csv` (per cell and statistic, the Spearman and log–log
Pearson association between the *recorded* pooled eigengap and the width of that
replicate's own null, with Fisher-z intervals; `status = unavailable` for record
sets predating the spectrum field).

The standardized counterfactual is a **diagnostic, not a deployable test** — it
borrows a reference `z` distribution from the null-control cells. Within-replicate
studentization is a no-op: it rescales both sides of the comparison and leaves
the p-value unchanged.

Note that `enumerate_study` adds two cells the profile does not request — a
`none` Type I baseline and a `translation` negative control. They are kept on
purpose: they are the null-control reference the standardized counterfactual
calibrates against.

The 2026-09-01 run of this profile is written up in
`docs/reports/angle-null-pivotality-2026-09-01.md`.

Interpretation notes:

- **Diagonal of the specificity matrix** is power at the largest
  `effect_size` for the matching statistic; off-diagonals are
  specificity (should sit near α).
- **Type I table** reads the `none` cells. Both per-statistic and the
  combined rule should respect α within Monte Carlo uncertainty.
- **Acceptance report** is non-gating — it's a structured record of
  whether pre-specified targets were met given the SE of the
  rejection-rate estimates.

## 9. Programmatic API

The CLI scripts are thin wrappers around the public API exposed in
`motco.simulations.study.__init__`. You can drive everything from
Python if you prefer:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from motco.simulations.study import (
    load_study_config, enumerate_study, run_shard,
    summarize_study, summarize_combined_rule,
    build_specificity_matrix, build_power_curves, build_type_i_table,
    evaluate_targets, write_report_csvs, write_target_report,
)

config = load_study_config("examples/trajectory_power_study/smoke.json")
grid   = enumerate_study(config)

# Shard 0 of 4, in-process:
records = run_shard(grid, shard_index=0, n_shards=4,
                    out_dir=Path("/tmp/motco-smoke"),
                    error_policy="record")
```

## 10. Troubleshooting

- **Reference cache missing** (`ReferenceCacheMissingError`) — the
  committed `data/intersim_reference.npz` is absent from the install.
  Reinstall the package, or regenerate it once in an R environment with
  InterSIM: `Rscript src/motco/simulations/export_reference.R
  --output-dir <dir>` then `build_cache_from_export(<dir>)`. No R is
  needed for normal runs.
- **Shard wallclock spills past `#SBATCH --time`** — the shard is
  resumable: just resubmit the failed array task ids. Then either
  lower the per-shard load (raise `N_SHARDS`) or raise `--time`.
- **Memory blowups under high `n_jobs`** — RRPP's parallel workers
  each hold a copy of the permuted residuals. Lower
  `--cpus-per-task` and re-probe.
- **Reports disagree with what you expect on a null cell** — check
  that `effect_sizes` starts at `0.0` and that `none` survived
  enumeration; both are required for the Type I view.
- **Re-running an old shard skips everything / produces no new
  records** — the parameter signature includes a seed-derivation
  version. After changes to derivation logic or the generator surface
  (e.g. the move to the numpy generator), shard files produced before
  the change have a stale signature and are re-executed automatically
  on the next `run_shard`. No manual deletion needed.
