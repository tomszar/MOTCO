"""Descriptive specificity instrumentation for the feature-surgery modes.

Characterizes how MOTCO *responds* to each realistic trajectory difference —
which statistics move and how much they cross-talk — rather than gating on a
clean diagonal. For each mode it generates several replicates, evaluates them
through the MOTCO trajectory test with RRPP, and reports the per-statistic
rejection rate plus a group-vs-stage projection diagnostic (how much of the
injected group signal lands in the disease/stage-discriminant subspace).

This is a *descriptive* tool, not a pass/fail gate: cross-talk and even
non-detection are findings, not failures. The heavier cluster-run study
produces the definitive specificity matrix and power curves.

The magnitude mode's off-target ``angle``/``shape`` response is **not** the
methylation ``rev.logit`` nonlinearity, as this module previously stated: the
per-omic population geometry of a scaled-delta trajectory is exactly
size-only (``angle`` and ``shape`` are 0 to machine precision at
``population_native``). It is block asymmetry — ``magnitude_kind='all'``
scales ``delta_methyl`` alone while the measurement space standardizes and
concatenates all three omic blocks, so the pooled trajectory rotates purely
because one component grew and the others did not. See
:func:`decompose_block_response`, which reads that decomposition out of
recorded geometry.
